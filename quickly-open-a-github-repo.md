|                                | What?          | Why? | How? | Note                                         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ---- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Use Github web                 | -              |      |      |                                              |
| Open the repo in `vscode.dev`  |                |      |      |                                              |
| Use a 3rd-party online editor  | `github1s`[^1] |      |      | Also works with `gitlab` repo, `npm` package |
| Temporary clone and peek at it | `git-peek`[^2] |      |      |                                              |
| Clone and have your own copy   |                |      |      |                                              |
